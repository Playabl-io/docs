# Calendar Cutoff

_Requires Admin role_

You can control how far in advance community members can post games using the calendar cutoff functionality. When a date is set, members will not be able to post games beyond this date. You can come back later to update the date and allow games to be posted further in advance, or you can remove the date and remove the restriction entirely.
