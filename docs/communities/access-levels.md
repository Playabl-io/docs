# Access Levels

Access levels are a powerful tool in managing RSVP access for games in your community. You can create levels that give members priority access, and you can make rules mandatory or optional for creators when setting up games.

## Understanding access levels

An access level defines a period of priority access to be able to RSVP to a game before others. By default, every community has an access level called "default" that grants 0 hours priority access.

When you create a new access level, and a creator assigns it to their game or it is a mandatory policy, only members with that access level will be able to RSVP until the priority time period has passed. If there are multiple access levels assigned, these will run concurrently, with the longest time period starting first.

For example, let's say there are two access levels defined:

1. New members, which grants 24 hours priority access
2. Paid members, which grants 72 hours priority access

When a game is created, and both levels are assigned or required, for the first 48 hours, only members with "Paid members" access will be able to RSVP. Then, for the next 24 hours, "Paid members" and "New members" will be able to RSVP, while general members will not. Finally, after the last 24 hours has elapsed, all community members will have RSVP access.

## Creating and editing access levels

_Requires Admin role_

You can create and edit communities from the Manage section of your community. Create a new access level by clicking the "circle plus" icon.

An access level has certain qualities:

- **Name** - this is the title of the access level.
- **Priority access time** - this is how long before general sign-up that members with this access will have priority.
- **Mandatory status** - you can choose to make this access level mandatory when new games are created.
- **Automatic grant status** - you can choose for new members joining the community to receive this access level automatically. If this is not selected, you will have to manually add this access to members.

After you've decided on each, click Save to save your access level.

### Editing and deleting

To edit an access level, click on it and the edit drawer will open pre-filled with the access level's details. Make any edits necessary and select Save.

From the edit drawer, you can also delete the access level by selecting the trash icon in the lower left corner. Confirm your choice to permanently delete the policy.

Note that editing and deleting an access level does not update existing games and their RSVP times.
