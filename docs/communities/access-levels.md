# Access Levels

Access levels are a powerful tool in managing RSVP access for games in your community. You can create levels that give members priority access, and you can make rules mandatory or optional for creators when setting up games.

## Understanding access levels

An access level defines a period of priority access to be able to RSVP to a game before others. By default, every community has an access level called "default" that grants 0 hours priority access.

When you create a new access level, and a creator assigns it to their game or it is a mandatory policy, only members with that access level will be able to RSVP until the priority time period has passed. If there are multiple access levels assigned, these will run concurrently, with the longest time period starting first.

For example, let's say there are two access levels defined:

1. New members, which grants 24 hours priority access
2. Paid members, which grants 72 hours priority access

When a game is created, and both levels are assigned or required, for the first 48 hours, only members with "Paid members" access will be able to RSVP. Then, for the next 24 hours, "Paid members" and "New members" will be able to RSVP, while general members will not. Finally, after the last 24 hours has elapsed, all community members will have RSVP access.
