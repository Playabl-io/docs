# Invite Links

_Requires Admin role_

You can quickly invite people to join your community using invite links. Each invite link is unique and is valid until you delete it.

You can create an invite link from the Manage section of your community. Locate the Invite Links section and click "Create new invite link". A unique link is generated and can be easily copied by clicking it.

When someone follows an invite link, they'll be prompted to create a Playabl account if they do not have one, and then they will have a single button available to finish accepting the invite.

To revoke an invite link click the ban icon to the right of the link you want to revoke. This link will no longer allow others to join the community.
