### User preferences

#### Time of Day

You can set a start and end time to help identify sessions and games that occur during your preferred times. This setting will impact the games shown when browsing the main browse page. If all of a game's sessions are outside of your time, then it is not included in the results. If it has one or more sessions that are in your time, the game is still included, and the sessions outside of your time will be listed separately so they are easy to identify.

This setting also applies when viewing game pages. A visual indicator is added to any session that is outside of your preferred time range.
