# Starting a community

You can make a new community by navigating to [https://app.playabl.io/communities/new](https://app.playabl.io/communities/new). Here, you'll be asked some questions about the community, including some descriptions and tags to help others identify if this community is of interest. Creating a community is fast and only takes a few minutes. Once you have it created, you have some things to think about and decide for how you want to run your community. We'll cover those next.

## What to consider when managing a community

You have lots of control when managing a community, and you can always change these settings later. Some of the most important settings to configure are the Community Sign Up, Access Levels, and Calendar Cutoff.

### Community sign up

This setting controls who can join your community. If set to public, others can join without any invitation or need to request membership.
Requested allows others to submit a request for membership which you can then approve or deny. And, private only allows people to join via invite link.

### Access levels

Access levels give you a lot of power to control when various groups within the community receive RSVP access. But, if you don't care about people having different RSVP priority, they are also something that you can mostly ignore. By default, your community has a standard access policy that does not give anyone priority over anyone else, and it's applied by default. If you want to consider a more advanced setup, see the [Access Levels Guide](./access-levels.md)

### Calendar Cutoff

Another optional configuration you might want to consider is a calendar cutoff. Use this if you want to limit how far in advance creators can schedule their games. You can come back later to update the date, or clear it to remove the restriction.

## Community pages

Once created, you can customize and manage your community and it's profile. Each community has sub-pages, some of which are only visible to community admins.

### Home

This is the main community page and displays info about your community for everyone. This page is public and one of the main ways someone will consider joining the community. From the home page, people can see various points of info about the community including how many members and upcoming games it has.

### Calendar

Your community calendar is a public page that displays upcoming games. This area is planned for a revamp soon to bring the browsing experience inline with the main browse page.

### Manage

Manage contains several pages that are limited to community admins and can be used to update and configure the community. From here, you can change various community settings and perform management tasks such as assigning member roles and access, update the furthest posting date, configure integrations, and others.
